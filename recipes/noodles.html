<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. </p>
   <p> Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. 
    It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>
<li>6 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces</li>
<li>â…“ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
         Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
         Drain and return pasta to pot.</li>
         <li>Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined. </li>

</ol>
